# AI Studio Gems

An open-source Chrome extension that supercharges Google's AI Studio with powerful workflow features, allowing you to save, manage, and reuse your best system instructions as "Gems".

---

## Features

This extension seamlessly integrates into the AI Studio interface to provide a native-feeling experience. All your data is stored locally and securely on your machine using `chrome.storage.local`.

### 1. Reusable System Instructions (Gems)
- **Save & Load:** Never lose a powerful system instruction again. Save any text from the "System Instructions" panel as a named Gem. Load it back instantly from a clean, native-style dropdown menu.
- **Support for Large Prompts:** Built with `chrome.storage.local`, allowing you to save massive, complex system instructions (up to 5MB).

### 2. Full CRUD Operations
- **Create:** Click the `+` icon to create a new Gem. The dropdown cleverly transforms into an input field for a seamless workflow.
- **Update (Save):** Modify your instructions and click the `Save` icon to overwrite and update the currently selected Gem.
- **Delete:** Remove gems you no longer need with a dedicated `Delete` icon.

### 3. Smart State Persistence
- The extension is smart. If you load a Gem, close the panel, and reopen it later in the same session, it will remember which Gem is active and display its name correctly.

### 4. Default Gem for New Chats
- **Set as Default:** Use the 3-dot menu to set any Gem as your default.
- **Auto-Load:** When you start a new chat session, the extension automatically loads your default Gem into the System Instructions panel the first time you open it, streamlining your workflow.

### 5. SPA-Aware Logic
- Designed to work flawlessly with AI Studio's Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. The "Default Gem" feature works reliably whether you're doing a full page reload or navigating internally by clicking the "New Chat" button.
